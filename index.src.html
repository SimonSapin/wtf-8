Abstract: WTF-8 (Wobbly Transformation Format − 8-bit) is a superset of <a>UTF-8</a> that encodes <a>surrogate code points</a> if they are not in a <a lt="surrogate code point pair">pair</a>. It represents, in a way compatible with UTF-8, text from systems such as JavaScript and Windows that use <a>UTF-16</a> internally but don’t enforce the <a>well-formedness</a> invariant that surrogates must be paired.

<h2 id=intended-audience>
Intended audience</h2>

  <a>WTF-8</a> is a hack intended to be used internally in self-contained systems
  with components that need to support <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a>
  for legacy reasons.

  Any <a>WTF-8</a> data <em>must</em> be converted
  to a <a lt="Unicode text">Unicode</a> encoding at the system’s boundary
  before being emitted.
  <a>UTF-8</a> is recommended.
  <a>WTF-8</a> <em>must not</em> be used to represent text
  in a file format or for transmission over the Internet.

  In particular,
  the <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/">Encoding Standard</a> [[ENCODING]]
  defines <a>UTF-8</a> and other encodings for the Web.
  There is no and will not be any
  <a href="https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/#names-and-labels">
  encoding label</a> [[ENCODING]] or
  <a href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets/character-sets.xhtml">
  IANA charset alias</a> [[CHARSETS]]
  for <a>WTF-8</a>.


<h2 id=motivation>
Background and motivation</h2>

  <em>This section is non-normative.</em>

  When <a href="http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode1.0.0/">Unicode 1.0</a>
  was published in 1991,
  it defined 65536 <a>code points</a> from U+0000 to U+FFFF
  and assigned characters to around half of them.
  Many software implementations chose the obvious memory representation
  for Unicode text of 16 bits per <a>code point</a> / character.

  At the time, “Unicode” was synonymous with that particular encoding.
  To disambiguate, that encoding is now called <dfn>UCS-2</dfn>.

  As subsequent versions of Unicode assigned more characters,
  it became apparent that 65536 <a>code points</a> would not be sufficient.
  Unicode was extended to 1114111 <a>code points</a> from U+0000 to U+10FFFF,
  and the <a>UTF-16</a> encoding was introduced.
  This encoding preserves compatibility with existing 16-bit based systems
  and represents new (<a lt="supplementary code point">supplementary</a>) code points
  as a <a lt="surrogate 16-bit code unit pair">pair</a> of “surrogates”.

  <a>UTF-16</a> is designed to represent any Unicode text,
  but it can not represent a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>
  since the corresponding <a>surrogate 16-bit code unit pairs</a>
  would instead represent a <a>supplementary code point</a>.
  Therefore, the concept of <a>Unicode scalar value</a> was introduced
  and <a>Unicode text</a> was restricted to not contain any <a>surrogate code point</a>.
  (This was presumably deemed simpler that only restricting pairs.)

  <a>UTF-16</a> was redefined to be <a>ill-formed</a>
  if it contains <a>unpaired surrogate 16-bit code units</a>.
  <a>UTF-8</a> was similarly redefined to be <a>ill-formed</a>
  if it contains <a>surrogate byte sequences</a>.

  Meanwhile, 16-bit based systems had little to no incentive
  to do anything about surrogates:
  For several years,
  Unicode did not assign any character to <a>supplementary code points</a>,
  and then (until emoji) only comparatively rare characters.
  Additionally, the Unicode Standard does not require conforming implementations
  to maintain <a>well-formedness</a> of <a>UTF-16</a> strings.

  As a result, surrogates do occur in practice and need to be preserved.
  For example:

  <ul>
    <li>
      In ECMAScript (a.k.a. JavaScript),
      <a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/#sec-4.3.16">
      a <code>String</code> value</a>
      is defined as a sequence of 16-bit integers
      that <em>usually</em> represents <a>UTF-16</a> text
      but may or may not be <a>well-formed</a>.
    <li>
      <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374069%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
      Windows applications normally use UTF-16</a>, but
      <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365247%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#maxpath">
      the file system treats path and file names as an opaque sequence of <code>WCHAR</code>s</a>
      (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383751%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#WCHAR">16-bit
      code units</a>).
  </ul>

  We say that strings in these systems are encoded in <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a>
  or <a>WTF-16</a>.

  <a>Unpaired surrogate 16-bit code units</a> are the only case
  where an arbitrary sequence of <a>16-bit code units</a> is <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>.
  <a>UTF-8</a>, however, is more complex
  and maintaining its <a>well-formedness</a> is arguably more valuable.

  This specification defines <a>WTF-8</a>,
  a superset of <a>UTF-8</a> that can losslessly represent
  arbitrary sequences of <a>16-bit code unit</a> (even if <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>)
  but preserves the other <a>well-formedness</a> constraints of <a>UTF-8</a>.


<h3 id=cesu-8>
Differences with CESU-8</h3>

  Unicode defines a <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr26/">
  Compatibility Encoding Scheme for UTF-16: 8-Bit (CESU-8)</a>.
  <a>WTF-8</a> is different from CESU-8.

  CESU-8 encodes <a>supplementary code points</a> as <a>surrogate pair byte sequences</a>
  of six bytes,
  whereas <a>WTF-8</a>, like <a>UTF-8</a>, encodes them as sequences of four bytes.
  Therefore, CESU-8 is not a superset of <a>UTF-8</a>.

  CESU-8 is also a mapping on <a>UTF-16</a> code units.
  Therefore <a>unpaired surrogate byte sequences</a> are <a>ill-formed</a> in CESU-8,
  whereas supporting them is the entire point of <a>WTF-8</a>.

  <!--
  CESU-8 was probably not designed,
  but rather just happened when 16-bit based systems
  tried to emit <a>UTF-8</a> but failed to handle <a>surrogate 16-bit code unit pairs</a> properly.
  Unicode Technical Report #26, which defines CESU-8,
  was written as after the fact to specify existing practices.

<h2 id=terminology>
Terminology</h2>

  These definitions correspond to those of the
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/">Glossary of Unicode Terms</a>. [[!UNICODE]]

  A Unicode <dfn>code point</dfn> is any value in the Unicode codespace;
  that is, the range of integers from 0 to 1114111.
  It is noted with a “U+” prefix and four to six hexadecimal digits:
  the first and last code points are U+0000 and U+10FFFF.

  The <dfn>Basic Multilingual Plane</dfn> is
  the range of <a>code points</a> from U+0000 to U+FFFF.

  A <dfn>BMP code point</dfn> is a <a>code point</a> in the <a>Basic Multilingual Plane</a>.

  A <dfn>supplementary code point</dfn>
  is a <a>code point</a> not in the Basic Multilingual Plane.
  That is, a <a>code point</a> in the range from U+10000 to U+10FFFF.

  A <dfn>Unicode scalar value</dfn>
  is a <a>code point</a> that is not a <a>surrogate code point</a>.
  That is, a <a>code point</a> in the range from U+0000 to U+D7FF,
  or in the range U+E000 to U+10FFFF.

  A <dfn>BMP scalar value</dfn> is a <a>Unicode scalar value</a>
  in the <a>Basic Multilingual Plane</a>.
  That is, a <a>code point</a> in the range from U+0000 to U+D7FF,
  or in the range U+E000 to U+FFFF.

  <dfn>Unicode text</dfn> is a sequence of <a>Unicode scalar values</a>.

  <dfn>UTF-8</dfn> is an encoding of <a>Unicode text</a> using 8-bit bytes.
  Each <a>Unicode scalar value</a> is represented as a sequence of one to four bytes.

  <dfn>UTF-16</dfn> is an encoding of <a>Unicode text</a> using <a>16-bit code units</a>.
  <a>BMP scalar values</a> are represented as a single <a>16-bit code unit</a> with the same value.
  <a>Supplementary code points</a> are represented as a <a>surrogate 16-bit code unit pair</a>.

  Note: this specification is only concerned with the UTF-16
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#character_encoding_form">encoding form</a>
  (based on <a>16-bit code units</a>),
  and not with the
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#character_encoding_scheme">encoding scheme</a>
  (based on bytes, with UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE variants).

  A string is <dfn lt="well-formed|well-formedness">well-formed</dfn>
  (not <dfn lt="ill-formed|ill-formedness">ill-formed</dfn>)
  in a given encoding if it follows the specification of that encoding.
  [[!UNICODE]] defines
  <a href="http://www.unicode.org/glossary/#well_formed_code_unit_sequence">
  Well-Formed Code Unit Sequence</a>
  for <a>UTF-8</a> and <a>UTF-16</a>.

  <div class=note>
    In particular:

    <ul>
      <li><a>Unpaired surrogate 16-bit code units</a> are <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>.
      <li><a>Surrogate byte sequences</a> are <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>UTF-8</a>.
      <li><a>Surrogate pair byte sequences</a> are <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>WTF-8</a>.
    </ul>
  </div>

  The <dfn>replacement character</dfn> is the <a>code point</a> U+FFFD
  <code>REPLACEMENT CHARACTER</code> (&#xFFFD;).
  It is used as a substitute to replace <a>ill-formed</a> sub-sequences
  during a conversion.

  A <dfn>16-bit code unit</dfn> is a 16-bit integer used in <a>UTF-16</a>.
  It is noted with a “0x” prefix and four hexadecimal digits:
  the first and last 16-bit code units are 0x0000 and 0xFFFF.

  Note: The byte serialization or memory representation of a <a>16-bit code unit</a>
  (little-endian or big-endian)
  is out of scope for this specification.

  When an algorithm iterates over a sequence (“For every <var>i</var> in …”),
  <dfn lt="consume">consuming</dfn> the next item means advancing in the sequence
  such that that item will be skipped during the following iteration of the loop:
  the item after the next becomes the next item.

  <div class=example>

    The following algorithm prints “1”, “2”, and “4”.

    For every digit <var>i</var> in “1234”, run these substeps:

    <ol>
      <li>Print <var>i</var>
      <li>If <var>i</var> is 2, <a>consume</a> the next digit.
    </ol>
  </div>

  An <dfn>unpaired surrogate 16-bit code unit</dfn> is a <a>surrogate 16-bit code unit</a>
  that is not part of a <a>surrogate 16-bit code unit pair</a>.


<h3 id=surrogates-byte-sequences>
Surrogate byte sequences</h3>

  Note: A <a>surrogate byte sequence</a>
  (and therefore any byte sequence described in this section)
  is <a>ill-formed</a> in <a>UTF-8</a>.
  Decoders are required to treat it as an error.

  A <dfn>lead surrogate byte sequence</dfn> or <dfn>high surrogate byte sequence</dfn>
  is a sequence of three bytes

<h2 id=ill-formed-utf-16>
Potentially ill-formed UTF-16</h2>

  A sequence of <a>16-bit code units</a> is <dfn>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</dfn>
  if it is intended to be interpreted as <a>UTF-16</a>,
  but is not necessarily <a>well-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>.
  It effectively encodes a sequence of <a>code points</a>
  that do not contain any <a>surrogate code point pair</a>.

  Note: Like <a>UTF-16</a>,
  <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a> can not represent a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>
  since the corresponding <a>surrogate 16-bit code unit pair</a> would instead
  represent a <a>supplementary code point</a>.
  Unlike <a>well-formed</a> <a>UTF-16</a>, it might contain isolated <a>surrogate code points</a>.

  Any sequence of <a>16-bit code units</a>
  has an interpretation as <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a>.

  <dfn>WTF-16</dfn> is sometimes used as a shorter name for <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a>,
  especially in the context of systems were originally designed for <a>UCS-2</a>
  and later upgraded to <a>UTF-16</a> but never enforced <a>well-formedness</a>,
  either by neglect or because of backward-compatibility constraints.


<h3 id=encoding-ill-formed-utf-16>
Encoding</h3>

  To <dfn id=encode-ill-formed-utf-16>encode from <a>code points</a> to
  <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a></dfn>,
  run these steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>result</var> be a sequence of <a>16-bit code units</a>, initially empty.
    <li>For every <a>code point</a> <var>P</var> of the input, run these substeps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          If <var>P</var> is a <a>supplementary code point</a>,
          append to <var>result</var> two <a>16-bit code units</a> of values:
          <ol>
            <li><code>((<var>P</var> - 0x10000) >> 10) + 0xD800</code>
            <li><code>((<var>P</var> - 0x10000) & 0x3FF) + 0xDC00</code>
          </ol>
        <li>Otherwise (<var>P</var> is a <a>BMP code point</a>),
          append to <var>result</var> a <a>16-bit code unit</a> of value <var>P</var>.
      </ol>
    <li>Return <var>result</var>.
  </ol>

  Note: If the input is restricted to <a>Unicode text</a>,
  this is identical to encoding to <a>UTF-16</a>
  and the resulting sequence is <a>well-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>.

  <div class=note>

    If, on the other hand, the input contains a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>,
    the conversion will be incorrect and
    the resulting sequence will not represent the original code points.

    This situation should be considered an error,
    but this specification does not define how to handle it.
    Possibilities include aborting the conversion,
    or replacing one of the <a>surrogate code points</a> of the pair
    with a <a>replacement character</a>.
  </div>


<h3 id=decoding-ill-formed-utf-16>
Decoding</h3>

  To <dfn id=decode-ill-formed-utf-16>decode from <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a>
  to <a>code points</a></dfn>,
  run these steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>result</var> be a sequence of <a>code points</a>, initially empty.
    <li>For every <a>16-bit code unit</a> <var>U</var> of the input, run these substeps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          If <var>U</var> is a <a>lead surrogate 16-bit code unit</a>,
          <var>U</var> is not the last <a>16-bit code unit</a> of the input,
          and the next <a>16-bit code unit</a> of the input <var>next</var>
          is a <a>trail surrogate 16-bit code unit</a>,
          then
          <a>consume</a> <var>next</var>
          and append to <var>result</var> a <a>code point</a> of value
          <code>
            0x10000 +
            ((<var>U</var> - 0xD800) &lt;&lt; 10) +
            (<var>next</var> - 0xDC00)</code>.
        <li>
          Otherwise,
          append to <var>result</var> a <a>code point</a> of value <var>U</var>.
      </ol>
    <li>Return <var>result</var>.
  </ol>

  Note: By construction,
  the resulting sequence does not contain a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>.

  Note: If the input is <a>well-formed</a> in <a>UTF-16</a>,
  this is identical to decoding <a>UTF-16</a>
  and the resulting sequence is <a>Unicode text</a>.


<h2 id=generalized-utf8>
Generalized UTF-8</h2>

  For the purpose of this specification,
  <dfn>generalized UTF-8</dfn> is an encoding of sequences of <a>code points</a>
  (not restricted to <a>Unicode scalar values</a>)
  using 8-bit bytes,
  based on the same underlying algorithm as <a>UTF-8</a>.
  It is a strict superset of <a>UTF-8</a>
  (like <a>UTF-8</a> is a strict superset of ASCII).

  Each <a>code point</a> is encoded as a sequence of one to four bytes:

<h2 id=the-wtf-8-encoding>
The WTF-8 encoding</h2>

  <dfn>WTF-8</dfn> (Wobbly Transformation Format − 8-bit)
  is an encoding of <a>code point</a> sequences
  that do not contain any <a>surrogate code point pair</a>
  using 8-bit bytes.

  Note: Like <a>UTF-8</a> is artificially restricted to <a>Unicode text</a>
  in order to match <a>UTF-16</a>,
  <a>WTF-8</a> is artificially restricted to exclude <a>surrogate code point pairs</a>
  in order to match <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a>.

  It is identical to <a>generalized UTF-8</a>,
  with the additional <a>well-formedness</a> constraint that
  a <a>surrogate pair byte sequence</a> is <a>ill-formed</a>.
  It is a strict subset of <a>generalized UTF-8</a>
  and a strict superset of <a>UTF-8</a>.

  Note: Similarly, <a>UTF-8</a> is a strict superset of ASCII.

  <a>WTF-8</a> <em>must not</em> be used for interchange.
  See <a href="#intended-audience">Intended audience</a>.


<h3 id=encoding-wtf-8>
Encoding</h3>

  To <dfn id=encode-to-wtf-8>encode from <a>code points</a>
  to <a>well-formed</a> <a>WTF-8</a></dfn>,
  run these steps:

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>result</var> be a sequence of bytes, initially empty.
    <li>For every <a>code point</a> <var>P</var> of the input, run these substeps:
      <ol>
        <li>

          If <var>P</var> is a <a>lead surrogate code point</a>,
          <var>P</var> is not the last <a>code point</a> of the input,
          and the <var>next</var> <a>code point</a> is a <a>trail surrogate code point</a>,
          set <var>P</var>’s value to:
          <code>
            0x10000 +
            ((<var>P</var> - 0xD800) &lt;&lt; 10) +
            (<var>next</var> - 0xDC00)</code>.

        <li>Depending on <var>P</var>:
          <dl class=switch>
            <dt>U+0000 to U+007F
            <dd>Append to <var>result</var> one byte of value <var>P</var>.
            <dt>U+0080 to U+07FF
            <dd>
              Append to <var>result</var> two bytes of values:
              <ol>
                <li><code>0xC0 | (<var>P</var> >> 6)</code>
                <li><code>0x80 | (<var>P</var> & 0x3F)</code>
              </ol>
            <dt>U+0800 to U+FFFF
            <dd>
              Append to <var>result</var> three bytes of values
              <ol>
                <li><code>0xE0 | (<var>P</var> >> 12)</code>
                <li><code>0x80 | ((<var>P</var> >> 6) & 0x3F)</code>
                <li><code>0x80 | (<var>P</var> & 0x3F)</code>
              </ol>
            <dt>U+FFFF to U+10FFFF
            <dd>
              Append to <var>result</var> four bytes of values
              <ol>
                <li><code>0xF0 | (<var>P</var> >> 18)</code>
                <li><code>0x80 | ((<var>P</var> >> 12) & 0x3F)</code>
                <li><code>0x80 | ((<var>P</var> >> 6) & 0x3F)</code>
                <li><code>0x80 | (<var>P</var> & 0x3F)</code>
              </ol>
          </dl>
      </ol>
    <li>Return <var>result</var>.
  </ol>

  Note: If the input contains a <a>surrogate code point pair</a>,
  the resulting byte sequence will be not represent
  the original sequence of <a>code points</a>.
  Instead, it will represent the same <a>code points</a>
  as if had been encoded in <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a>.
  This is also consistent with
  encoding each <a>code point</a> to <a>WTF-8</a> individually,
  and <a lt="concatenate two WTF-8 strings">concatenating</a>
  the resulting <a>WTF-8</a> byte sequences.


<h3 id=decoding-wtf-8>
Decoding</h3>

  To <dfn id=decode-from-wtf-8>decode from <a>well-formed</a> <a>WTF-8</a>
  to <a>code points</a></dfn>,
  run these steps:

  Note: Since <a>WTF-8</a> <em>must not</em> be used for interchange
  (see <a href="#intended-audience">Intended audience</a>),
  this algorithm is deliberately not defined for arbitrary byte sequences.
  It is only defined for byte sequences known to be <a>well-formed</a> in <a>WTF-8</a>,
  such as sequences
  <a lt="encode from code points to well-formed WTF-8">encoded from code points</a>,
  <a lt="convert from potentially ill-formed UTF-16 to WTF-8">converted from UTF-16</a>, or
  <a lt="concatenate two WTF-8 strings">concatenated</a>
  from sequences themselves <a>well-formed</a> in WTF-8</a>.

  <ol>
    <li>Let <var>result</var> be a sequence of <a>code points</a>, initially empty.
    <li>For every byte <var>B</var> of the input, depending on <var>B</var>:
      <dl class=switch>
        <dt>0x00 to 0x7F
        <dd>Append to <var>result</var> a <a>code point</a> of value <var>B</var>.

        <dt>0xC2 to 0xDF
        <dd>
          Let <var>B2</var> be the next byte and <a>consume</a> it.

          Append to <var>result</var> a <a>code point</a> of value
          <code>
            ((<var>B</var> & 0x1F) &lt;&lt; 6) +
            (<var>B2</var> & 0x3F)</code>

        <dt>0xE0 to 0xEF
        <dd>
          Let <var>B2</var> and <var>B3</var> be the next two bytes,
          and <a>consume</a> them.

          Append to <var>result</var> a <a>code point</a> of value
          <code>
            ((<var>B</var> & 0x0F) &lt;&lt; 12) +
            ((<var>B2</var> & 0x3F) &lt;&lt; 6) +
            (<var>B3</var> & 0x3F)</code>

        <dt>0xF0 to 0xF4
        <dd>
          Let <var>B2</var>, <var>B3</var>, and <var>B4</var> be the next three bytes,
          and <a>consume</a> them.

          Append to <var>result</var> a <a>code point</a> of value
          <code>
            ((<var>B</var> & 0x07) &lt;&lt; 18) +
            ((<var>B2</var> & 0x3F) &lt;&lt; 12) +
            ((<var>B3</var> & 0x3F) &lt;&lt; 6) +
            (<var>B4</var> & 0x3F)</code>
      </dl>
    <li>Return <var>result</var>.
  </ol>

  Note: If the input is also <a>well-formed</a> in <a>UTF-8</a>,
  this is identical to decoding <a>UTF-8</a>
  and the resulting sequence is <a>Unicode text</a>.


<h3 id=converting-wtf-8-ill-formed-utf-16>
Converting between WTF-8 and potentially ill-formed UTF-16</h3>

  To <dfn>convert from <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a> to <a>WTF-8</a></dfn>,
  run these steps:

  <ul>
    <li><a>Decode from potentially ill-formed UTF-16 to code points</a>
    <li><a>Encode from code points to well-formed WTF-8</a>
  </ul>

  Note: This conversion never fails and is lossless.

  To <dfn>convert from <a>WTF-8</a> to <a>potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a></dfn>,
  run these steps:

  <ul>
    <li><a>Decode from well-formed WTF-8 to code points</a>
    <li><a>Encode from code points to potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a>
  </ul>

  Note: This conversion never fails
  and, if the input is <a>well-formed</a> in <a>WTF-8</a>, is lossless.


<h3 id=converting-wtf-8-utf-8>
Converting between WTF-8 and UTF-8</h3>

  Since <a>WTF-8</a> is a superset of <a>UTF-8</a>,
  any sequence of byte that is <a>well-formed</a> in <a>UTF-8</a>
  is also <a>well-formed</a> in <a>WTF-8</a> and represents the same text.
  To <dfn>convert from <a>UTF-8</a> to <a>WTF-8</a></dfn>,
  return the input unchanged.

  Note: This conversion never fails and is lossless.

  To <dfn>convert lossily from <a>WTF-8</a> to <a>UTF-8</a></dfn>,
  replace any <a>surrogate byte sequence</a>
  with the sequence of three bytes &lt;0xEF, 0xBF, 0xBD>,
  the <a>UTF-8</a> encoding of the <a>replacement character</a>.

  Note: Since <a>surrogate byte sequences</a> are also three bytes long,
  this conversion can be done <em>in place</em>.

  Note: This conversion never fails but is lossy.

  To <dfn>convert strictly from <a>WTF-8</a> to <a>UTF-8</a></dfn>, run these steps:

  <ol>
    <li>If the input contains a <a>surrogate byte sequence</a>, return failure.
    <li>Otherwise, return the input unchanged.
  </ol>

  Note: This conversion is lossless when it succeeds, but it can fail.


<h3 id=concatenating>
Concatenating WTF-8 strings</h3>

  Concatenating <a>WTF-8</a> strings requires extra care to preserve <a>well-formedness</a>.

  To <dfn>concatenate two <a>WTF-8</a> strings</dfn>, run these steps:

  <ol>
    <li>
      If the left input string   ends with a <a>lead surrogate byte sequence</a>
      and the right input string starts with a <a>trail surrogate byte sequence</a>,
      run these substeps:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Let <var>lead</var> and <var>trail</var> be two <a>code points</a>,
          the respective results of
          <a lt="Decode from well-formed WTF-8 to code points">decoding from WTF-8</a>
          these two <a>surrogate byte sequences</a>.
        <li>
          Let <var>supplementary</var> be the
          <a lt="Encode from code points to well-formed WTF-8">encoding to WTF-8</a>
          of a single code point of value
          <code>0x10000 + ((<var>lead</var> - 0xD800) &lt;&lt; 10) + (<var>trail</var> - 0xDC00)</code>
        <li>
          Let <var>left</var> be substring of the left input string
          that removes the three final bytes.
        <li>
          Let <var>right</var> be substring of the right input string
          that removes the three initial bytes.
        <li>
          Return the concatenation of
          <var>left</var>, <var>supplementary</var>, and <var>right</var>.
      </ol>
    <li>Otherwise, return the concatenation of the two input byte sequences
  </ol>

  Note: This is equivalent to
  converting both strings
  <a lt="convert from WTF-8 to potentially ill-formed UTF-16">
  to potentially ill-formed UTF-16</a>,
  concatenating the resulting <a>16-bit code unit</a> sequences,
  then converting the concatenation back
  <a lt="convert from potentially ill-formed UTF-16 to WTF-8">to WTF-8</a>.
